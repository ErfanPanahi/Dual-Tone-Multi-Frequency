# Dual-Tone-Multi-Frequency

**Introduction:**
*Dual-Tone Multi-Frequency (DTMF) is a technical term referring to the dual-frequency audio tones generated by pressing telephone keys. This method, sometimes also referred to as touch tone, was initially used for transmitting telephone signals to local switch centers and receiving signals from them. However, nowadays, it has found various other applications in the field of telecommunications.*

**Approach Description:**
*Each telephone key is assigned a dual-tone (two tones with different frequencies), one with a low frequency and the other with a high frequency, which are played simultaneously upon pressing the key. (This is the sound you hear after dialing a phone number!) It's worth mentioning that the likelihood of reproducing the combination of these two tones with a human voice is very low.*

*As depicted in the diagram, each of the 4 rows of the keypad is assigned one of the low-frequency tones, and for each of the 3 columns, one of the high-frequency tones is assigned. The keys in the fourth column, labeled A, B, C, and D, are customizable and mostly have military applications.*

*In this exercise, you are required to implement both the synthesis and analysis sections of this type of signaling, based on the descriptions provided in the figure.*
